            <h1>EDUCATION AND TRAINING</h1>
            <p>Besides public health research, HAP gives equivalent focus to building research capacity in the medical community including doctors and undergraduate students . The purpose of this is to conduct good research and entice them into the world of medical research.</p>

            <h3>Problem Solving for Better Health (PSBH)</h3>
            <p>Since 1993, Health Action by People has been associating itself with 71 medical colleges in India on an exciting health problem solving experiment with undergraduate medical students. The project titled Problem Solving for Better Health is international in character and exists in 30 countries. The Indian Programme is unique in focusing attention on medical students generally under the leadership of the Department of Community Medicine. The programme imparts problem solving skills in community health to undergraduate medical students through an intensely participatory workshop, lasting 3-4 days. The feedback from the faculty and students is quite positive. The programme fulfils the objectives laid down by Indian Medical Council , on learning public health and community Medicine<img src="images/logo/pshb2.jpg" class="align-right slide-in active"></p>
            
            <p>Health Action by People is the prime mover of this project in India. It is a group of competent public health professionals with a wide range of teaching and research experience. The success of the programme depends on the leadership provided by the host faculty in each college</p>
                
            <p>During the workshop, the students identify ‘problems’ which are then developed into research protocols under the guidance of facilitators. After the workshop, the faculty selects a few protocols for implementation. The projects so selected are assigned to a group of 3-4 students.After completing the study the students have to present their work in a reunion workshop. The participating colleges were provided with some financial support from HAP for conducting workshops. The PSBH project was supported by Dreyfus Health Foundation (DHF), New York till October 2006. Presently the support given by HAP for the PSBH project and Research Methodology workshops as limited to providing certificates and badges to the participants and faculty</p>

            <p><b>C R Soman School of Health Research (CRSSHeR)</b> is a HAP initiative started in honour of its founder-chairman, Professor C R Soman. Prof. Soman had a passion for both teaching and research.</p>
            <p>A series of workshops on research methodology were conducted under his leadership in many health institutions in India.CRSSHeR continues this tradition.</p>
            <p>Our goal is to train the younger generation of teachers and researchers in health, including doctors, nurses and other health workers, so that they are capable of undertaking independent research on the problems facing the state.</p>
            <p>CRSSHeR conducts research workshops both at its headquarters in Trivandrum, as well as in collaboration with other institutions.Major themes of recent workshops have been: Research Methodology, Occurrence Measures in Epidemiology, Measurement in Health Research, Descriptive Statistics using R and others.</p>

            <h3>Non Communicable Disease Prevention and Training Unit ( NPTU)</h3>
             <p>India is moving its focus from control of communicable disease now to addressing the dual burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases. The state of Kerala, with great achievements in healthcare, is now facing a rising burden of non-communicable diseases. The state is making attempts to tackle this growing problem. Health Action by People has made significant contributions in the past to highlight the fact that we need to address non-communicable diseases and provided rich information on the epidemiology of non-communicable diseases in Kerala. Now HAP is moving towards activities in prevention of non-communicable diseases and training of health care professionals and public about these diseases. A non-communicable disease prevention and training unit (NPTU) is being set up, in partnership with St. John’s Research institute, Bangalore. Two subunits of the NPTU unit, already set up, will be addressing Chronic Respiratory Diseases and School Health. Other sub-units are being set up to address all other non-communicable diseases, including Diabetes, Cardiovascular diseases, Stroke, Mental Health, etc.</p>
