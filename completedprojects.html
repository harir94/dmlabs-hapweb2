                        <h4>Indo-Danish Collaboration on Diabetes Epidemiology (INDADE)</h4>
                        <h5>Collaborators: University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark, Novonordisk</h5>
                        <p>Studies by HAP have established that Kerala has among the highest reported prevalence of type 2 diabetes. However, little is known about the sequel of diabetes or its economic impact on the population. It is against this backdrop that HAP has fostered a partnership with the University of ODENSE and Novo Nordisk to undertake pioneering studies on epidemiology of diabetes, with special emphasis on social and economic costs of diabetes mellitus. The project on diabetes screening was implemented on a section of the existing PROLIFE cohort initiated by HAP selecting one of the Panchayats namely Ottoor for the study. Both men and women, who attained the age of 20 years and above, were included. HAP was able to establish ‘Diabetes Epidemiology Population Laboratory’ which was an important component of this project. As part of this project we conducted three rounds of diabetes screening and those who were detected to be diabetic ( new cases ) as well as self reported diabetics were asked to attend annual medical examinations to check complications if any as a result of diabetes. We conducted annual medical examinations in the year 2010 and 2011. During annual medical checkup camps we looked for retinopathy, nephropathy, cardiopathy and peripheral neuropathy. Those who were detected with any of these complications were notified by issuing health cards</p>

                        <h4>Harmful Use of Alcohol in Kerala- Social and Economic Impacts on Families and State</h4>
                        <p>This study was commissioned by the Govt. of Kerala in light of growing concerns about excessive consumption about alcohol in the state. The study was aimed at providing an overview of the nature and pattern of alcohol use to understand the pathways of harmful use, the extent of harm associated with families and the community. It was concluded by exploring policy options and their feasibility for the reduction of harmful use of alcohol in the local context. It was carried out extensively across over 3000 households in three districts of the state- Kasargod, Kottayam and Thiruvananthapuram.The study involved detailed analysis, including both quantitative and qualitative aspects. The study found that there were significant secondary and tertiary effects of alcohol consumption, in addition to negative individual effects. The study also brings forth a number of recommendations, primary among which is generating awareness, youth-based interventions for prevention and implementation of a stringent legal and monitoring mechanism as long-term solutions. The study also delves into the current Alcohol Policy in Kerala and asserts the need of a detailed, critical analysis of the same</p>

                        <h4>Factors associated with prescription of non-RNTCP Anti-TB drugs by private practitioners practicing RNTCP in Trivandrum city</h4>
                        <h6>An operational research study funded under Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme and State Health & Family Welfare Society-TB, Kerala (State H & FW -TB Society)</h6>
                     
                        <p>The Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) based on the internationally recommended DOTS strategy was initially implemented mainly through the network of health care facilities under the public health departments of the state governments. However studies have shown that the private sector is the first point of contact for more than half of the TB patients. Realizing the significant roles that the various health sectors could play in TB control, the RNTCP has established collaborations with a wide range of health care providers which have resulted in many unique models of Public- Private Mix (PPM) in RNTCP. Thus the PPM DOTS in India is a strategy to diagnose and treat TB patients under RNTCP utilizing a mix of different types of health care providers</p>
                        <p>There exist a good number of private doctors who do offer RNTCP services to all their patients and do their best to convince the patients that RNTCP offers the best possible services for diagnosis and treatment, including uninterrupted quality controlled drugs for the patient. Despite this many of their patients opt for Private treatment. The reasons for this are poorly understood. A significant number of TB patients continue to receive non RNTCP drugs. Usually this is because the patients attend a facility which does not offer RNTCP services, like a private hospital where the doctors do not practice RNTCP. The reasons for this have been widely studied. However the factors responsible for a prescription of non-RNTCP Anti-TB drugs by private practitioners practicing RNTCP have not been properly studied. The study intends to capture the profile of TB patients opting private institutions for treatment and reasons for patient approaching a private hospital despite the RNTCP functioning so well in the public secto</p>
